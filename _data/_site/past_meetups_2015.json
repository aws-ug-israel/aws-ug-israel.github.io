Nowadays we can find servers that are installed, launched, process data and terminate - all within a range of minutes. This new accelerated lifecycle makes traditional security processes such as periodic patches, vulnerability scanning, hardening, and forensics impossible. In this accelerated lifecycle, there are no maintenance windows for patches or ability to mitigate vulnerability, so the security infrastructure must adapt to new methods. In this new thinking, we require automation of instance security configuration, hardening, monitoring, and termination. Because there are no maintenance windows, Servers must be patched before they boot up, security configuration and hardening procedures should be integrated with server installation and vulnerability scanning and mitigation processes should be automatic. In this presentation, we announce a new open source tool called \"Cloudefigo\" and explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demonstrate how to launch a pre-configured, already patched instance into an encrypted storage environment automatically while evaluating their security and mitigating them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live demo, we leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object storage for provisioning automated security configuration, integrating encryption, including secure encryption key repositories for secure server's communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are resilient, automatically configured, with reduced attack surface.</i></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1421665085000,"duration":10800000,"id":"219930975","name":"Big Data(EMR, DynamoDB)  - Deep Dive by AWS Product Managers","rsvp_limit":250,"status":"past","time":1422887400000,"local_date":"2015-02-02","local_time":"16:30","updated":1422964761000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":250,"venue":{"id":23518707,"name":"Iron Source","lat":0.0,"lon":0.0,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Lilienblum St 28, 1- floor","city":"Tel Aviv-Yafo","country":"il","localized_country_name":"Israel"},"group":{"created":1361877610000,"name":"Israel AWS User Group","id":7356292,"join_mode":"open","lat":32.06999969482422,"lon":34.77000045776367,"urlname":"AWS-IL","who":"Members","localized_location":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","region":"en_US"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/AWS-IL/events/219930975/","manual_attendance_count":249,"description":"<p>Agenda: </p> <p>16:30 \u2013 17:00 Gathering </p> <p>17:00 \u2013 18:00 - Amazon <b>Elastic MapReduce</b> Deep Dive and Best Practices </p> <p>18:00 \u2013 19:00 - Amazon <b>DynamoDB</b>: Data Modeling and Scaling Best Practices</p> <p><i>19:00 - 19:20 - <b>IronSource</b> - </i>how IronSource leverages Lambda to keep separate, cross-account environments synchronized in real time.</p> <p>19:20 - 19:40 - <b>SundaySky</b> - <i>using DynamoDB to drive a real time bidding (RTB) platform for personalized video ads.</i> </p> <p>19:40 \u2013 20:00 - <b>Open Q&amp;A</b> (People can submit questions in the meetup including their expectations from the sessions).</p> <p><b>Amazon Elastic MapReduce Deep Dive and Best Practices</b> - Join this advanced technical session on Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) for an introduction to Amazon EMR design patterns.
