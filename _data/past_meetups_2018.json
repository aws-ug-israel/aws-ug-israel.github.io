Additionally, the adoption of a Shift Left strategy, with more frequent tests and run earlier in the development cycle, increases the need for developers (not just traditional QA professionals) to have the knowledge and tools needed to be able to run these tests. While open source load testing tools like JMeter, Gatling, and others are great, they each have a steep learning curve and using these tools as part of Continuous Integration makes it even more challenging. We will have an interactive session on Taurus, an open source test automation tool designed for developers, and that helps to overcome numerous testing challenges.

You have a lot to catch up with. In this talk, we will share the evolution of our microservices architecture in AWS - how we started, what has changed since and where we are now.
