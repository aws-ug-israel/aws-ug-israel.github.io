Additionally, the adoption of a Shift Left strategy, with more frequent tests and run earlier in the development cycle, increases the need for developers (not just traditional QA professionals) to have the knowledge and tools needed to be able to run these tests. While open source load testing tools like JMeter, Gatling, and others are great, they each have a steep learning curve and using these tools as part of Continuous Integration makes it even more challenging. We will have an interactive session on Taurus, an open source test automation tool designed for developers, and that helps to overcome numerous testing challenges. We\u2019ll show how to: Easily create and run any open-source load test scripts using Taurus<br/>Leverage AWS EC2 to scale tests to any desired level of traffic, by spinning up thousands of AWS cloud instances within minutes</p> <p>Guy Salton is a Sr. Professional Services Engineer at CA-BlazeMeter, specializing in Jenkins, Continuous Integration (CI) and JMeter.

You have a lot to catch up with. In this talk, we will share the evolution of our microservices architecture in AWS - how we started, what has changed since and where we are now. We will discuss some of the (good and bad) decisions we took, what we learned in the process and where we\u2019re heading next.</p> <p>Moshe Ben Shoham is a System Architect at Perfecto, bringing over 17 years of experience in the world of software (out of which almost 10 at Perfecto), with strong engineering professional skills in enterprise software, development methodologies, DevOps and cloud services.
