These startups, don\u2019t always remain small, as some grow quickly, struggling to hold on to that innovation mentality. There are also large companies that are trying to learn from startups, how to stay relevant in the field.</p> <p>This meetup will discuss the innovative scaling solutions by AWS and Wix and the culture and technologies to support such solutions.

Over this 10 years journey, we have learned a thing or two - some DOs and some DON'Ts.</p> <p>In this presentation I will go over the evolution of Wix architecture, with the different transformations we have done to support Wix at scale. We will share some of our insights about building a web infrastructure for over 90M users<br/>Bio:</p> <p>Yoav Abrahami is the Chief Architect at Wix.com, working with developers and operations on building wix future products as well as accelerating and improving development processes. Prior to joining Wix.com, Yoav was an Architect at Amdocs Cramer OSS division. Yoav has a MS in Physics and BS in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University.</p> <p><b>Scaling Your Business in Amazon Style - Guy Ernest</b></p> <p>In Amazon we are very passionate about helping our customers grow to become the next Amazon, Netflix, IronSource or Waze. We learned so much from our own experience and from the experience of many of our customers, and we love to share this experience with others.</p> <p>We see many small startups that are growing very quickly and struggling to keep the startup (=innovation) mentality. We also see many big companies that are trying to learn from startups how to stay relevant in a competitive market. It is more about agility, independence, smart application, collaboration, and the culture and technologies that can support it.<br/>In this lecture, I will share my personal experience and Amazon experience in solving scale problems. Machine learning is one of these scale solutions, and it is also the reason we broken down Amazon to very small two-pizza teams, and the tools that we give to these teams to have superpowers to innovate fast.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Guy Ernest is the Principal Business Development Manager, Machine Learning at AWS. He joined Amazon more than 4 years ago as a solution architect and helped in building the technical team of AWS in Israel. 2 years ago, he moved to Amazon HQ in Seattle to work as a solution architect for Amazon.com, helping one of the largest companies on the planet to use the cloud better. He recently moved to a business development role in one of my passions of machine learning and deep learning, and helping customers to adopt \u201cML first\u201d strategies.He also spent 25 years in various technical roles in the IDF, in his own startups and some big companies.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1480361615000,"id":"235887326","name":"re:Cap - re:Invent 2016 new services & updates","status":"past","time":1482249600000,"local_date":"2016-12-20","local_time":"18:00","updated":1482262196000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":157,"venue":{"id":23518707,"name":"Iron Source","lat":0.0,"lon":0.0,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Lilienblum St 28, 1- floor","city":"Tel Aviv-Yafo","country":"il","localized_country_name":"Israel"},"group":{"created":1361877610000,"name":"Israel AWS User Group","id":7356292,"join_mode":"open","lat":32.06999969482422,"lon":34.77000045776367,"urlname":"AWS-IL","who":"Members","localized_location":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","region":"en_US"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/AWS-IL/events/235887326/","description":"<p>We will be going tough the new service releases and updates from the re:Invent 2016 conference </p> <p><b>18:00 - 18:30 - Gathering, Beer &amp; Pizza</b></p> <p><b>18:30 - 19:30 - New services &amp; updates overview</b> </p> <p>CEO Andy Jassy Keynote #1</p> <p>CTO Werner Vogels Keynote #2</p> <p><b>19:30 - 20:30 - Amazon Athena</b></p> <p>Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
