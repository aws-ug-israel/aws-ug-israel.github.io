Machine learning is the engine that drives massive businesses such as Amazon.com, Netflix, Intuit, Autodesk and many others. The Flywheel of machine learning is hard to start spinning, but once it is spinning it can move huge markets. After working with these giants and contributing my share to their flywheel, I'll be happy to share what I learned and how you can get the most out of your business using the agility of the cloud and the power of machine learning technologies that are available through it.</p> <p>- by Guy Ernest VP Data and AI at AllCloud</p> <p>19:00 - 19:30 - What led us to build SageMaker and features under the hood<br/>- How Hyper-parameter Tuning Works<br/>- How Auto-Scaling works<br/>- Security in SageMaker (i.e., model encryption)<br/>- How automatic A/B Testing works</p> <p>- by Vladimir Zhukov Director of Engineering, Machine Learning and AI at AWS</p> <p>Vlad Zhukov leads engineering teams for Amazon SageMaker, a fully-managed platform that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. In addition to Amazon SageMaker, since joining AWS in 2016, Vlad has helped to build several AWS machine learning services in the natural language processing (NLP) space. Before AWS, Vladimir has held engineering and leadership roles at Here Technologies, Nokia, and Oracle.</p> <p>19:30 - 20:00 - Questions &amp; Networking</p> <p>Needs a location - [masked]</p> ","visibility":"public"}]
